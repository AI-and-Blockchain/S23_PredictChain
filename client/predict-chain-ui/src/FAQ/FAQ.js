Users will be able to upload datasets to train predictive models, or submit queries to those models. These various models will be operated by a central node or nodes with computing resources available. A variety of models will be made available, ranging from cheap, fast, and simple to more expensive, slower, and more powerful. This will allow for a large variety of predictive abilities for both simple and complex patterns. All the past predictions form these models will be stored on the blockchain for public viewing.</h4>
