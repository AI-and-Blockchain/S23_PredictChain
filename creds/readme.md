# Credential Files

In this folder, there will need to be several `*.creds` files containing the 
credentials for the project.  These have been omitted from the public repository for
security reasons and will have to be filled manually with the help of project contributors.

These are as follows:

* `algo_api_key.creds` with content:

    > < an_algorand_api_key >

---

* `client.creds` with content:

    > < a_client_public_address >
    > 
    > < a_client_secret_key>

---

* `oracle.creds` with content:

    > < the_oracle_public_address >
    > 
    > < the_oracle_secret_key>

    > **_NOTE:_** the oracle is a special node and its credentials should be kept constant 
    > in all instances of this project

---

* `web3_api_key.creds` with content:

    > < the_web3_storage_api_key >
