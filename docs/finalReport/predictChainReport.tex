\section{Project Description}

PredictChain is a marketplace for predictive AI models. Users are able to upload datasets for training predictive models,
request that train models be trained on any previously uploaded datasets, or submit queries to those trained models.
These various models will be operated by a central node or nodes with computing resources available. A variety of
models will be made available, ranging from cheap, fast, and simple to more expensive, slower, and more powerful.
This will allow for a large variety of predictive abilities for both simple and complex patterns.  All the past predictions
form these models will be stored on the blockchain for public viewing.

\subsection{Problem Solved}
\emph{Clearly state the problem your project solves}

PredictChain helps to solve one of the main issues that involve AI models today: accessibility.  Our project fulfils this
need in two ways.  Oftentimes, individuals or groups poses data that they would wish to be used in predictive analysis.
However, these people may not have access to the compute capacity to train predictive models on this data.  Additionally,
yet other people have neither access to predictive training data, nor do they have access to computational resources.
PredictChain solved both of these problems simultaneously.

When users upload their datasets, they allow model to be trained on those datasets.  Higher quality datasets will produce
higher quality models.  When users submit parameters for training, they allow the model that their parameters produce to
be used publicly.  Both of these users are rewarded for their work when a model is queried, and it produces a correct prediction.
This encourages users to participate in contributing the resources needed for good predictions, while leaving a public
record for other users to view.

\section{Implementation Details}

\emph{Provide details of how you implemented your solution. Please add as many diagrams as necessary and explain the
diagrams you added in the text.

The structure of PredictChain is primarily broken up into two parts: the client and the oracle.  Both of these parts interact
with each other through the blockchain.

\subsection{The Client}

The client serves as a middleman between the front end user interface and the
blockchain.  It is run as a server, serving UI content to the user, taking in requests from the UI, and parsing those
requests into a form suitable for both the blockchain and for the oracle.  Additionally, the client constantly polls
for updates coming from the oracle, through the blockchain.  These updates are queued and sent to the front end upon request.
This allows the user to both interact with the blockchain and to see important updates that come from it.

\subsection{The Oracle}

The oracle accomplishes the majority of the other tasks that this project requires.  It constantly polls for updates
coming from the client, through the blockchain.  Upon receiving these updates, it begins the execution of one of its
main operations.  These are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Downloading a user-specified dataset and saving it
    \item Training one of the raw models based on user inputted parameters
    \item Querying one of the trained models on user inputted data and comparing it to the real-world result
\end{itemize}

After each of these operations, the oracle sends out several transactions.  These can be either rewards to contributors
of a model or confirmations/results of the operation that has been performed.

When working with user-submitted datasets, the oracle uses a handler to manage the operations performed on that dataset.
The handler can save datasets to a specified environment, load datasets from a specified environment, parse that dataset
as a pandas dataframe, and split the dataset by the values of one of its attributes.  The environments that the handler's
recognize are \textit{local} and \textit{ipfs}.  When using either of these environments, the handler abstracts away the
complexities of working with either of them into a unified interface.

\subsection{The Blockchain}

In PredictChain, the blockchain serves as both a records keeper and a messenger between the client and the oracle.
